assume computers will never understand human language. But as a company that builds artificial
intelligence to do just that, it's our job to overcome this assumption. There's no doubt that AI systems
are capable of solving remarkably complicated problems. Why should language — perhaps the most
impactful problem of all — be any different?So here's the challenge: making inherently ambiguous
language more like the highly structured world of chess. And to develop that structure, two techniques
have proven equally critical: natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding
(NLU). NLP organizes language into the structured data that computers require to process, while NLU
interprets that data to derive meaning.To appreciate the strides computers have already made toward
understanding language, let’s talk about one of the first major challenges put before them: chess. Chess
is no less complex than language, and yet computers were capable of defeating even chess
grandmasters decades ago. By considering a huge amount of situational data, chess-playing programs
not only figure out their next move; they also anticipate the next three moves, five moves, and even ten
moves down the line. In this blog, we’ll cover:To learn why computers have struggled to understand
language, it’s helpful to first figure out why they're so competent at playing chess. Chess, needless to
say, isn’t easy. There are more possible moves in a game than there are atoms in the universe.But while
playing chess isn’t inherently easier than processing language, chess does have extremely well-defined
rules. There are certain moves each piece can make and only a certain amount of space on the board for
them to move. Computers thrive at finding patterns when provided with this kind of rigid structure. Yet
language is not so formulaic. It breaks rules all the time.In the lingo of chess, NLP is processing both the
rules of the game and the current state of the board. How can you move your bishop? Where is your
opponent's queen? An effective NLP system takes in language and maps it — applying a rigid, uniform
system to reduce its complexity to something a computer can interpret. Matching word patterns,
understanding synonyms, tracking grammar — these techniques all help reduce linguistic complexity to
something a computer can process.Figure 1: At its most basic level, NLP involves treating each utterance
as a unique string of words, with minimal interpretation. In this example — a chatbot only knows the
preprogrammed phrase “I need Zoom,” and it is unable to respond to slightly altered phrasing.The
easiest way to structure unstructured language is to treat each unique utterance as its own data point.
The equivalent in chess would be making moves completely dependent on the opponent’s last move:
advancing a pawn simply because the other person moved their rook. Obviously, this is a losing strategy
— both in chess and in language learning. While creating a chatbot like the example in Figure 1 might be
a fun experiment, its inability to handle even minor typos or vocabulary choices is likely to frustrate
users who urgently need access to Zoom. While human beings effortlessly handle verbose sentences,
mispronunciations, swapped words, contractions, colloquialisms, and other quirks, machines are
typically less adept at handling unpredictable inputs.Figure 2: The goal of NLP is to provide structure to
unstructured, ambiguous language.In Figure 2, we see a more sophisticated manifestation of NLP, which
gives language the structure needed to process different phrasings of what is functionally the same
request. With a greater level of intelligence, NLP helps computers pick apart individual components of
language and use them as variables to extract only relevant features from user utterances.With NLP, we

reduce the infinity of language to something that has a clearly defined structure and set rules. To put it
simply, we make language more like chess. Crucially, however, the job isn’t done yet. Assembling the
information extracted by NLP, NLU focuses primarily on comprehension: understanding utterances in
the context of the broader conversation to choose the right response.A number of advanced NLU
techniques use the structured information provided by NLP to understand a given user's intent. These
techniques include paraphrase detection, which determines whether a pair of utterances has the same
meaning, and topic switching, which enables AI to follow a non-linear conversation that naturally jumps
around different subjects.Figure 3: NLU goes beyond processing language at face value: it illuminates a
user’s underlying intent.NLU is an integral part of NLP. If NLP is about understanding the state of the
game, NLU is about strategically applying that information to win the game. Thinking dozens of moves
ahead is only possible after determining the ground rules and the context. Working together, these two
techniques are what makes a conversational AI system a reality. Consider the requests in Figure 3 —
NLP’s previous work breaking down utterances into parts, separating the noise, and correcting the typos
enable NLU to exactly determine what the users need.While NLP and NLU are not interchangeable
terms, they both work toward the end goal of understanding language. There might always be a debate
on what exactly constitutes NLP versus NLU, with specialists arguing about where they overlap or
diverge from one another. But, in the end, NLP and NLU are needed to break down complexity and
extract valuable information.Figure 4: Both NLP and NLU play an important role in understanding a
user’s request, but the line where one approach ends and the other begins is blurry.To win at chess, you
need to know the rules, track the changing state of play, and develop a detailed strategy. Understanding
language involves the same three elements. And like playing chess, the key is constant improvement.
Chess and language present more or less infinite possibilities, and neither have been solved for good.
Yet the more we know, the better decisions we make. By working diligently to understand the structure
and strategy of language, we’ve gained valuable insight into the nature of our communication. Building a
computer that perfectly understands us is a massive challenge, but it’s far from impossible — it’s already
happening with NLP and NLU.Contact Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce

Researcher, Data AnnotationKate Lubrano, Annotation ManagerFor a long time, chatbots suffered from
a negative reputation, primarily due to their frequent misunderstandings of user requests. Many users,
subject to the limitations of primitive, script-bound chatbots, longed to speak to live agents who could
comprehend their needs the first time around. Recognizing this frustration, artificial intelligence (AI)
developers sought solutions to harness the technology's distinguishing capacity to learn and evolve
continually, ultimately setting it apart from static, code-dependent software. By tapping into AI's
potential, researchers aim to reach the state of dynamic communication tools and leave rigid chatbots
behind.This adaptability employs high-quality annotated data, a crucial ingredient for developing
representative, successful, and unbiased AI models. Data annotation, the often unsung hero of AI, is the
key to reaching excellence. It plays an indispensable role in advancing intelligent conversational AI and
fostering chatbots that respond to human language naturally and intuitively.In this blog post, we aim to
illuminate the intriguing world of data annotation and highlight its significance in teaching chatbots to
interact seamlessly with users.We’ll cover: Annotation provides much-needed context and
categorization for machine learning models to extract valuable insights by way of assigning labels to raw
data. In this process, a taxonomy — a system of classification — is applied to systematically organize and
classify data.Data annotation is the backbone of modern AI applications. Its primary function is to help
machines comprehend and interpret various forms of data such as text, video, images, or audio. Thanks
to this methodical annotation, AI systems can process different types of content effectively.More
specifically, text annotation can be broken down into various tasks, including but not limited to:As
mentioned, annotation encompasses more than just textual formats. For instance, image or video
annotation may include classification, which entails categorizing images according to their content;
object recognition, which involves identifying and locating specific objects within images or video
frames; image segmentation, the process of dividing an image into regions representing distinct objects
or areas of interest; and boundary recognition, to further refine object identification.In this blog, we'll
primarily concentrate on text annotation, as it aligns with Moveworks' objective of comprehending and
interacting with enterprise language. However, please note that annotation is crucial to the
advancement of all AI, particularly with the ongoing development of large multimodal models that are
able to engage with images, audio, and more. Before getting into the importance of data annotation,
let's first acknowledge the inherent challenges posed by the ambiguity of human language. People

articulate their needs in vastly diverse ways — concise or lengthy, jargon-filled or formal. And on top of
that, a user’s goals carry more specificity than any taxonomy you apply to them. With seemingly infinite
possibilities to convey a message or pose a question, humans can still effortlessly communicate, as they
are naturally adept at comprehending linguistic nuances.But for an untrained AI system, deciphering the
essence of such communications can be an arduous task. To illustrate this challenge, consider a
colleague who shares a meandering story about their vacation and how they could not access the
company portal due to poor Wi-Fi service. Despite various HR-related keywords such as “vacation” and
“time off”, a human reader or listener would quickly infer that their issue was an IT problem, not an HR
problem. An untrained bot, in contrast, might struggle to prioritize the most relevant keywords. This is
precisely where data annotation steps in. Training AI models on high-quality, annotated data allows
them to grasp the complexity and diversity of natural language, separate the signal from the noise, and
focus on the most critical aspects of user input.This becomes particularly important when attempting to
predict user's needs based on a chosen taxonomy. Through maintaining a manageable level of
granularity in the annotation process, we can improve the decision-making skills of our AI. This method
contrasts with approaches used by some, where they assign a single intent to each piece of content, say
a knowledge base article, which could lead to reduced productivity and clarity in understanding users'
needs via a proliferation of intents.In turn, AI systems and chatbots can accurately respond to a wide
range of human communication with minimal effort. Data annotation empowers AI to comprehend the
nuanced symptoms users describe and connect them with solutions, cutting through linguistic
complexities and delivering elegant solutions. To sum up, data annotation is an essential component in
creating AI systems capable of providing meaningful user experiences. The impact of data annotation
spans industries and use cases, significantly enhancing the capabilities and practicality of AI-powered
solutions across the board. What is the role of annotators?An AI annotator's role is to systematically
review and label different data types, translating human language and inputs into machineunderstandable formats. Your brain most likely would automatically determine that if you try your
password incorrectly too many times, you may need your account unlocked, but machines require
annotated data to effectively learn patterns, make sense of data, and adapt their responses. Annotated
data is particularly crucial for training large language models (LLMs), as their key purpose is to digest,
interpret, and generate human-like conversation. Focusing on intent annotation, we define “intent” as
the ultimate goal or user need. Intent annotation acts as a bridge between human language and
machine language. Annotators review real messages sent to chatbots (utterances) and user-submitted
tickets. We do this review while protecting personal and sensitive information, incorporating the
principles of privacy by design and by default. Annotators label these user inputs using a taxonomy that
the bot understands and can map to its corresponding actions. For instance, a password resetting issue
might be labeled with Reset Authentication, which triggers the bot's specific skill. Through intent
annotation, annotators teach the AI system to recognize patterns in seemingly disparate phrasings and
accurately respond to meet users’ needs. A variety of techniques and approaches are available for
annotating your data. In this section, we will discuss the most popular methods - in-house, outsourced,
crowdsourced, and AI-driven annotation - and examine the strengths and weaknesses of each. In-house
annotation involves using your own team of dedicated annotators to process and tag the data, ensuring
a high level of control over quality and consistency of the annotations. Strengths: Weaknesses:
Outsourced annotationOutsourced annotation refers to delegating the data annotation tasks to a thirdparty provider that specializes in the field, such as a technology consulting firm or a managed services
provider. Strengths: Weaknesses: Crowdsourced annotation — a particularly popular approach in the

research community — relies on platforms that gather a large pool of contributors from around the
world to annotate data, usually on a pay-per-task model. Amazon Mechanical Turk is one example of
crowdsourced annotation platforms. Strengths: Weaknesses: AI-driven annotation employs machine
learning algorithms to automatically label the data. Over time, iteratively refining and improving the AI
model can achieve higher annotation accuracy. Strengths: Weaknesses: Analyzing the strengths and
weaknesses of each technique empowers you to make informed decisions that best suit your project
requirements, budget, and time constraints. Data annotation has far-reaching implications across
various industries. In teaching AI models to proficiently engage with user interactions, many businesses
can leverage the power of annotated data to drive innovation, improve customer experience, and
optimize processes. Below, we delve into some of the most notable applications of data annotation,
spanning sectors such as medical, retail, finance, legal, automotive, industrial, and employee support.
Medical: In the medical industry, annotated data enables AI systems to analyze medical images,
electronic health records, and diagnostic data. Examples of applications include detecting diseases in
radiology scans, predicting patient outcomes, and creating personalized treatment plans. There are also
significant and long-standing applications of annotation in medical research, such as the extraction of
information from published research papers. In this line of work, annotators are typically Ph.D.
scientists.Retail: Data annotation helps retail businesses better understand customer preferences,
improve inventory management, and optimize store layouts. Annotated data can also aid in creating AIdriven conversational assistants, which help customers with inquiries and product
recommendations.Finance: Financial institutions harness annotated data to develop AI models that
detect fraudulent activities, analyze market trends, and improve customer service. Data annotation also
is the key to creating chatbots that both answer customer questions and offer personalized investment
recommendations.Legal: In the legal sector, annotated data is invaluable for developing AI models that
can process and analyze vast amounts of legal documents, identifying relevant precedents, streamlining
contract review, and helping with e-discovery. Data annotation also contributes to creating AI-driven
tools that facilitate legal research, predict case outcomes, and assist in automating routine tasks —
reducing workload for legal professionals.Automotive: In the realm of autonomous vehicles, data
annotation is instrumental in training AI systems to recognize traffic signs, pedestrians, bicycles, and
other vehicles. Annotated data forms the foundation for the development of advanced driver-assistance
systems (ADAS), which significantly enhance road safety.Industrial: Data annotation supports AI system
adoption in the industrial sector, enabling predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring of equipment,
and quality control. Annotated data trains AI models to detect anomalies, optimize production
processes, and improve overall productivity. Employee Support: Annotated data is also crucial in
realizing intelligent employee support systems. By training AI models to accurately understand user
requests, machine learning-driven platforms can offer seamless assistance with IT support, HR issues,
and other workplace tasks, enhancing the overall employee experience. As illustrated by these
applications, data annotation is at the core of AI-driven innovations, empowering industries to leverage
machine learning and usher in a new era of smart solutions. The right investment in data annotation can
pave the way to unparalleled growth, revolutionizing businesses across diverse sectors. In an enterprise
setting, AI systems are expected to perform at their best, adapting to specific use cases and delivering
fluid experiences for customers and employees alike. For AI to thrive in this context, it must be
proficient in dealing with complex situations, recognizing domain-specific terminology, and making
accurate inferences based on user input. Data annotation is deeply involved in achieving these high
performance standards, as it is necessary for AI models to smoothly adapt to unique enterprise use

cases. Effective data annotation assists AI systems in better understanding various contexts within the
enterprise realm, such as: Clearly, data annotation is a vital aspect of any enterprise AI endeavor. The
process of annotating data allows AI systems to adapt to organization-specific demands and
complexities, delivering custom solutions that cater to unique use cases. Investing time and resources
into data annotation facilitates successful AI adoption, transforming operations and customer
interactions aligned with the ever-evolving digital landscape. Data annotation can be hindered by
challenges such as cost, accuracy, and ambiguity. Here’s a quick run-through of these limitations and the
ways annotators and enterprises can work together to overcome these obstacles.CostOne of the
primary challenges encountered in data annotation is the financial cost associated with hiring and
training annotators. Investing in annotators ensures high-quality annotations that lead to improved AI
system performance. Striking a balance between securing adequate resources for annotators and
managing organizational constraints is essential for maintaining an efficient annotation process.Ensuring
the accuracy of annotated data is crucial for the efficacy of AI models. Mislabeled datasets can
negatively impact AI performance, leading to undesirable outcomes, such as incorrect predictions or
responses. Annotators and enterprises must continuously monitor and maintain the quality of
annotations to ensure AI models are trained on the most accurate, current, and relevant data.One of the
greatest challenges of annotation is dealing with ambiguity. Words, acronyms, and abbreviations can
have multiple meanings. Annotators are able to consider the organization and the industry that the
utterance or ticket they are evaluating originated from, which can help narrow things down. The same
acronym could be referring to a particular form at one organization but an internal software tool at
another. In some cases, annotators are able to reference more specific customer language resource
documents in order to classify a resource type of a potentially ambiguous term with more accuracy. The
type of company a user works for can also be important to consider when determining intent. For
example, while at most organizations served by Moveworks utterances discussing health insurance are
likely to fall into our “Benefits” Resource label, if we know the organization is a health insurance
provider we may need to read deeper into the utterance to determine if it is about insurance being
provided to an external client.Further complicating annotation is the fact that each utterance can be
considered individually, without the context of the conversation history. Annotators must then assess
and annotate single utterances without having this context, which can occasionally make it difficult to
infer the intended meaning. Ambiguity is added when messages are cut off by a user hitting Enter too
soon, or in cases where a user is referencing something previously discussed with vague terms such as
“it” instead of naming the actual resource. In these cases, annotation can feel like an exercise in mind
reading, but expert annotators are typically able to make educated guesses based on their experience
reviewing similar utterances.Disagreement resolution is a process of addressing both annotator errors
and valid interpretive differences in opinion, ensuring data consistency, as well as refining guidelines. By
analyzing differing interpretations of user inputs, annotators can improve annotation quality.
Historically, collecting multiple opinions and resolving disagreements has helped us correct annotator
errors, identify ambiguous inputs, and refine project documentation. This process has also led to better
taxonomy definitions, minimizing biases while enabling the AI to ask clarifying questions when needed.
In pursuit of efficiency, the Moveworks team has reduced time spent on disagreement resolution,
instead aiming for an 85% organic agreement rate. Continuous improvements have resulted in
consistently reaching or even exceeding this goal, achieving high-quality data to train AI models
effectively. Data annotation is a critical process for creating high-quality labeled datasets used in many
machine learning applications. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of annotations, it is important to

establish clear guidelines for annotators to follow. This will lead to increased efficiency while helping
maintain a robust quality control process. The following is a list of key best practices that you should
consider when starting the annotation process. Prepare detailed and easy-to-read instructions: Provide
articulate guidelines for your annotators to follow, including examples and edge cases. This will help
avoid confusion and ensure that annotators understand how to handle various scenarios, leading to
more accurate annotations.Support humans with machines: Leverage machine learning techniques, such
as automated pre-annotations, to provide a starting point for human annotators. Machine-generated
suggestions can save time and help achieve consistent results, allowing annotators to focus on refining
the outcome and handling more complex cases. Focus on quality: Ensure you have a robust quality
control process in place throughout the data annotation project. This may involve periodic reviews,
inter-annotator agreement measurements, and addressing discrepancies, which can improve the
accuracy and consistency of the final dataset. Stay compliant: Be mindful of privacy policies, regulations,
and ethical considerations when annotating data. This includes proper data anonymization and
following guidelines relevant to specific domains such as finance, healthcare, or education. Iterate and
update guidelines: Data annotation is an ongoing process. As you gather more data and feedback,
update the guidelines accordingly to address new challenges and scenarios. Keep your guidelines
current and ensure that annotators are informed of any changes, maintaining consistency and
adaptability over time. Select the right annotation tools and techniques: Choose the best tools and
methodologies for your specific data annotation project as capable and precise tools make the process
annotator-friendly. This may vary depending on the type of data, the project's scope, and other factors.
Having the right tools can streamline the annotation process and improve efficiency. Encourage
communication and collaboration: Facilitate open communication between annotators and project
managers. Address questions and provide regular feedback, helping minimize errors, and fostering a
collaborative environment for annotators to learn from each other and make improvements. Diversify
your annotator team: Having a diverse range of perspectives among your annotators can reduce bias in
your dataset. Ensure that your training data is annotated by people with different backgrounds,
experiences, and skill sets to increase overall quality and impact. Set realistic goals and timelines:
Establish specific, measurable, and achievable goals for your data annotation project. Ensure that
project deadlines are realistic and considerate of the resources available. This will help manage
expectations, keep the team motivated, and deliver a high-quality annotated dataset in a timely
manner. As AI technology continues to rapidly evolve, AI-powered data annotation is poised to play a
significant role in reshaping various industries and transforming the way data is processed, organized,
and utilized. Here's an overview of the potential impact of AI annotation in the future: Scalability: AIdriven annotation can help scale the data annotation process exponentially, reducing the reliance on
human annotators and decreasing the time required for annotation tasks. This will enable organizations
to process larger volumes of data at unprecedented speeds, ultimately fueling faster AI system
development and deployment. Increased annotation efficiency and accuracy: Advanced machine
learning algorithms will be able to both automate and enhance the quality of annotations, minimizing
errors and inconsistencies. As AI systems become more intelligent, the gap between human and
machine-generated annotations will contract, with AI models increasingly handling complex tasks with
ease. Personalized AI models: With more annotated data, AI systems will be able to learn from diverse
user experiences and preferences, paving the way for highly personalized models. Tailoring AI outputs to
individual users will greatly benefit industries such as healthcare, education, marketing, and customer
service, promoting a more engaging and customized user experience. Greater accessibility to AI

technologies: The democratization of AI-powered data annotation will lower barriers to entry for
organizations looking to harness AI capabilities. With faster and more cost-effective annotation options,
even smaller entities and startups can access and utilize advanced AI technologies across various
domains. Ethical AI with reduced bias: As AI-driven annotation processes evolve, creating unbiased and
ethically sound AI models will be of paramount importance. Diversifying training data can help achieve
more representative and unbiased systems that consider a wide range of perspectives and serve a
broader audience. However, this approach is not without risks. It’s also possible that depending
exclusively on AI annotation will only perpetuate biases on a larger scale. Data annotation is integral to
the development of advanced AI systems and chatbots that interact seamlessly with users. By
understanding the intricacies of data annotation, we can empower AI to comprehend and empathize
with users, cutting through linguistic complexities and delivering optimal solutions across diverse
industries. With the right investment in data annotation, we can also establish a foundation for
unparalleled growth, revolutionizing businesses across the board. To leverage the full potential of data
annotation, we encourage readers to explore further resources on improving annotation, reducing
biases, and staying compliant. Keep an eye on the future of AI annotation, as it will continue to
transform and elevate the landscape of AI-assisted communication.Request a demo to see how your

modal Varun Singh, VP of ProductIf you’ve been following Moveworks for long, you understand the
enormous potential of AI to automate support for employees — while also allowing service desks to
spend more time on high-impact work. But for large and complex enterprises, achieving that level of
end-to-end automation isn’t easy. Everything from company policies to user permissions to knowledge
articles is in constant flux. New resources get added every day, while others become obsolete. And even
the most relevant resource for a Canadian employee on the Sales team might not help an engineer in
France. Without considering all of this nuance, automation projects often fail to get off the
ground.Moveworks is the first AI platform that’s purpose-built to automate support for the world’s

largest companies. And today, we’re announcing major enhancements to our platform, designed
specifically to handle these complex environments. At the core of this announcement is Adaptive
Response, a technique that enables our bot to serve up a completely custom answer based on user
context and past feedback. We’re also announcing expanded integrations, a context-aware permissions
system, and the ability to hand off high-touch issues to a live service desk agent. Collectively, the
enhancements allow large companies to deliver instant and effortless support to their employees, with a
single AI platform that keeps pace as their business evolves.Read the full announcement here.
Seemingly simple issues often demand complex solutions. A lot of behind-the-scenes effort is needed to
answer, “What’s the policy for taking time off?” And while a conventional chatbot would likely provide
one, pre-programmed response in every situation, Moveworks takes a deeply personalized and
contextual approach to support, one which adapts as companies change.With Adaptive Response,
Moveworks has taken this approach to the next level: automatically generating customized responses to
each issue, based on all available resources, in real time. Building on our existing conversational AI
system, Adaptive Response allows Moveworks to offer up multiple solutions when useful — for
instance, a form and two knowledge articles — in a format that’s optimized to resolve support issues as
quickly as possible:Figure 1: Adaptive Response gives Moveworks the ability to completely customize its
responses, from the resources it surfaces to even the format of the response itself.When someone asks
Moveworks about PTO, our bot considers everything from current context to user feedback, then
provides the best, most up-to-date resources for that person. In Figure 1, Moveworks serves up two
resources — a knowledge article and a form — that are tailor-made for the contractor who needs help.
Critically, Adaptive Response also accounts for the fact that answers change. If in two weeks this
contractor is hired to work full time, his answer would be drastically different. On top of this, new
resources are added, and old ones are retired all the time. At a company with thousands of knowledge
articles, forms, and workflows, keeping track of so many solutions can be a frustrating and manual job.
But by leveraging Adaptive Response and constantly incorporating new information, Moveworks finds
the ideal path to resolution, without involving the service desk. Support teams expend a huge amount of
effort to painstakingly build out their knowledge bases. The problem is that every department has its
own specialized tool — the HR team might keep its knowledge in Simpplr, the IT team in Confluence,
and the Finance team in SharePoint. As a result, employees struggle to track down the information they
need to stay productive. That’s why Moveworks is expanding its integrations with Simpplr, Cherwell,
Freshservice, and SharePoint on-premises. Now, when employees have questions, Moveworks can serve
up a precise snippet of information from within any of these tools, or even multiple snippets if helpful.
So instead of searching through endless systems or filing a support ticket, employees can simply
describe any issue to Moveworks — directly in Microsoft Teams or Slack — and get an answer in
seconds, all without any manual configuration. One of the biggest challenges in automating support is
that different users have different permissions. Making sure that only authorized users can see
restricted content isn’t something that simple, pre-programmed chatbots do well. In fact, even for the
service desk, it can be incredibly difficult to ensure that information always ends up in the right
hands.Figure 2: Moveworks considers the unique permissions of each user, such as their position,
seniority, and employment status.As of this release, we’ve revamped our permissions system to ensure
that only authorized employees see sensitive content. Our platform can now restrict access based on
location, seniority, department, and other important factors, understanding complex layers of user
information to provide individualized support automatically. And because Moveworks can ingest
existing access control roles from service desk systems, like ServiceNow, incorporating permissions into

the platform is straightforward for support teams. Moveworks automates a high percentage of issues all
by itself, but some situations will always require a person to step in and help out. Using natural language
understanding (NLU) to understand employees' requests, Moveworks works with Vayusphere to make a
seamless handoff to a live service desk agent — automatically triaging issues to the right expert. With
this new approach, employees get support from the right expert directly in their enterprise chat
platform. Figure 3: Moveworks streamlines the handoff to a live service desk agent via a deep
integration with Vayusphere.At Moveworks, we’re constantly working to unravel the complexities of
today’s digital world. And that means resolving every request for help — IT, HR, finance, facilities, or
otherwise — completely and autonomously.Each of the innovations we’ve announced today plays a role

ProductEveryone’s talking about conversational AI. Thought leader after thought leader is sounding off
about the importance of investing in a slew of machine learning-powered tools, practically shouting
from the rooftops about the transformational impact of AI-powered chatbots in the
workplace.Regardless of all the buzz around conversational AI, there’s little information out there on
what it can actually do. Resources for creating your own conversational AI strategy or even details on
everyday use cases are limited. Today, I’m here to show you that conversational AI is more than just a
buzzword. It’s a powerful tool that can make an immediate impact across your organization. Companies
like Palo Alto Networks and DocuSign are already using this technology to reshape every aspect of how
their teams get help at work. The immediate, real-time support provided by conversational AI powers
employee comms, offers insight into common issues, and much more — leaving employees more time
to focus on higher impact work. So let me introduce you to a fraction of what’s possible with
conversational AI on day one. The power of conversational AI lies in its ability to respond dynamically. It
isn’t limited by dialog flows or pre-scripted solutions. An AI-powered chatbot can help you perform
complex, multistep tasks like setting up PTO, troubleshooting Adobe Acrobat, or submitting an expense
report — without forcing you to learn a new interface. It immediately understands user requests and
responds in seconds.A major reason employees reach out to their IT or HR team is just to get basic
questions answered. Conversational AI can resolve common issues autonomously, freeing support

teams up to address higher-priority work.With conversational AI, you can autonomously provision, or
de-provision, the software your employees need to get work done. Instead of spending an hour on the
phone with IT, they can ask a chatbot for access and receive a response in as little as seconds.Even the
most capable support teams can find it difficult to keep track of hundreds of different users and all their
permissions. When an employee asks for access to Tableau, a deeply integrated conversational AI can
offer up a personalized solution, depending on that employee’s access level.By integrating with identity
management systems like Active Directory and Okta, conversational AI can proactively message
employees to prevent lockouts and securely restore access with no help desk
involvement.Conversational AI makes it possible for employees to fill out and submit forms directly in
their chat platform, using natural language. Filling forms — a process that once involved many different
platforms and steps — can be completed quickly and conversationally.Large enterprises typically handle
several thousand password issues every month. With conversational AI, employees can reset passwords
by asking a chatbot for help, meaning thousands fewer IT tickets to worry about.Conversational AI can
automatically route approvals to the right hands. Managers can easily accept or deny access using
natural language, ensuring that employees get what they need, from software to PTO, quickly and
securely. Companies use a range of strategies to communicate with their employees en masse, but
usually it comes down to firing off a bunch of emails. Even if your people pay attention to their inboxes,
this approach doesn’t make it easy for employees to ask follow-up questions provide information to
your comms team on who’s acted and who hasn’t. Conversational AI flips the script, turning one-way
messages into two-way conversations.Employees will always have questions when their company
launches a new policy or updates a security protocol. Whereas an email is a dead-end, when you send a
message with a chatbot, you’re sending an expert capable of answering any follow-up questions.On
their first day at a job, new hires drown in information. By sending onboarding materials via a
conversational chatbot, employees can start their jobs right — with the ability to prioritize top-of-mind
questions on day one.Your campaign doesn’t end after you send your message. Conversational AI offers
visibility into your comm’s performance. When you know who’s seen it and who’s taken action, you can
send a targeted reminder to ensure that the change you want to happen happens. Solving a support
issue involves multiple conversations between employees and service desks. But when each issue is
considered a unique, individual problem, it’s hard to see the big picture. By handling this back-and-forth
over chat, conversational AI resolves issues faster, minimizing support wait times and, even more
critically, offering unique insights into how to improve existing systems.Every company has common
support issues, from troubleshooting the VPN to getting a Zoom Pro license. AI can offer insight into the
issues employees have so that your team can build the right resources and make it even easier for
everyone to get the specific help they need.Many companies have hundreds or even thousands of
assignment groups, meaning that service desk agents struggle to determine where to route issues. A
chatbot solves common support issues instantly, but when expert help is needed — AI understands and
routes requests to the right assignment group.Support tickets can take forever to solve because they
involve multiple conversations between employees and service desks. But conversational AI handles
back-and-forth autonomously. From updating employees to nudging agents to closing tickets, AI makes
support seamless. I’ve only covered 13 conversational AI use cases here. But the applications are
limitless. It makes it possible for support teams to completely eliminate common pain points, allowing
new hires to ramp up quickly and long-time employees to grow.Conversational AI isn’t just about
automating onboarding tasks or expediting approvals. Rather, it allows support teams to make
thousands of tiny improvements in real time, transforming the employee experience.As more and more

organizations recognize people as their greatest assets, company leaders have come to realize that they
need to do more than drop buzzwords. They need to adopt the tools and technologies, including
conversational AI, that kickstart an employee experience where problems are solved in seconds over
simple conversation.Request a demo to see the Moveworks' conversational AI in action.

FounderIf you’re an IT leader, you know that most useful technology takes way too much of your time to
build, deploy, and maintain. And unless you happen to have a team of world-class AI experts on hand,
this do-it-yourself model makes truly game-changing technology seem out of reach.At Moveworks,
we’ve built a conversational AI chatbot that assists employees to instantly resolve their IT issues within
Microsoft Teams — without forcing you to hire your own AI experts. We build, deploy, and maintain the
hundreds of machine learning models that power our bot in-house, which means your help desk’s
workload starts disappearing on day one.Now, the Moveworks chatbot app is available for customers to
install directly from either Microsoft AppSource or the Teams store. Going from implementation to
impact with enterprise AI has never been easier.“By helping to quickly resolve employees’ IT issues
within Microsoft Teams, Moveworks allows companies to work faster. And in a world that now relies on
technology to collaborate, it’s never been more critical to provide real-time, location-agnostic tech
help.”Mike Ammerlaan, Director, Microsoft 365 Ecosystem at Microsoft In the past, fully deploying our
bot took eight weeks, but with the Moveworks chatbot app now available from Microsoft AppSource,
you can shrink that time-to-value even further — thanks to these added capabilities:For enterprise
Teams customers like Equinix, Moveworks has significantly enhanced the Teams platform in two distinct
ways. First, Moveworks allows Equinix employees already using Teams to fix their tech problems — from
accessing software to editing email lists to unlocking accounts — via quick, painless conversations with
our chatbot. And second, Moveworks intercepts IT issues submitted through other channels and then
resolves those issues on Teams, bringing new users to the platform. You can read Equinix’s success story
here on Microsoft.com.Particularly in this new normal of remote work, the ability to remain productive
anywhere and anytime defines successful employees. But without a physical office or access to inperson help, these employees often don’t know where to find critical resources.With Teams, however,
every key team member, workflow, and file is consolidated in a single place. And by adding Moveworks
to Teams, getting IT support is just as simple.Contact Moveworks to demo and deploy our AI chatbot in

here to read the full press release.Moveworks unveils a new, self-learning conversational AI technique,
which solves employees' requests by generating customized responses based on real-time
data.MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Moveworks, the AI platform that automates support at work, today
released new product enhancements to help employees navigate large and complex enterprise
environments. They include a self-learning conversational AI technique, Adaptive Response, which
generates customized responses to employees' requests in real time. Critically, the technique allows
Moveworks to offer more than one relevant solution — for instance, a form plus a knowledge article —
and to adapt future responses based on usage data.Moveworks also announced deep integrations with
Simpplr, Cherwell, Freshservice, and SharePoint on-premises; it can search these knowledge bases for
the snippet-sized answers to employees' questions. In addition, Moveworks now understands the
security permissions of each user, ensuring that the right resources end up in the right hands. The
enhanced platform is designed to keep pace as companies evolve, from automatically ingesting
knowledge articles to dynamically creating responses.Employees expect to get help right away, said
Moveworks CTO Vaibhav Nivargi. But in the context of a dynamic enterprise, identifying the forms,
knowledge articles, and workflows they need is a profoundly difficult problem for machine learning.
Moveworks is the first platform engineered to solve that problem. Between our new integrations, our
robust security controls, and our unscripted approach to conversation, we've automated support for the
world's largest companies.Adaptive ResponseAt large companies, there are often multiple resources
with the potential to solve an employee's request. An employee who asks for help with PowerPoint
might need a PowerPoint license, a troubleshooting guide, live support from an expert, or any
combination of the above. Moreover, support teams are constantly adding and updating resources.
When a company's travel policy changes on Friday, for example, the ideal AI chatbot gives employees
the new policy on Monday morning, without any manual work for a bot designer. Ultimately,
enterprises need the flexibility to serve different combinations of resources to different employees at
different moments in time — a challenge too complex for conventional chatbots that script out
responses in advance. By contrast, Moveworks' conversational AI system, Dynamic Flow™, generates
responses on the fly, considering a wealth of context to deliver personalized and up-to-date resources.
Adaptive Response further improves Dynamic Flow by offering a ranked spectrum of relevant solutions
when useful, such as in the example above, so employees can select their own path to resolution. In
these cases, more than 15 percent of requests are resolved by a resource other than the top-ranked

option, resulting in even more precise support.IntegrationsWhen it comes to maintaining an effective
knowledge base, most companies are forced to balance two competing interests. On one hand, every
department — from IT to HR to Finance — typically prefers to keep knowledge articles in its own,
specialized tool. But when documents are scattered across many different tools, employees struggle to
find the answers to their questions. In fact, per McKinsey, the average knowledge worker spends nearly
20 percent of the workday looking for internal information.Moveworks eliminates this trade-off: the
platform automatically ingests articles from every department's knowledge base — without any manual
configuration — and then answers employees' questions from a single interface on Microsoft Teams or
Slack. Now, Moveworks can provide just the most useful snippets of information from Simpplr, Cherwell,
Freshservice, and SharePoint on-premises, thanks to expanded integrations.PermissionsManaging
permissions is among the most significant challenges in supporting employees with AI. To ensure that
only authorized employees see sensitive content, Moveworks can now restrict access to forms and
knowledge articles based on location, department, seniority, and other factors. Importantly, the
platform is able to ingest existing access control rules within ServiceNow. This allows Moveworks to
surface different forms and articles to users who submit identical requests, according to their unique
permissions.Live Agent HandoffWith advanced machine learning, Moveworks is able to solve many
support issues completely automatically. However, for complex issues that require human intervention,
it's critical to get the right subject-matter experts involved as quickly as possible. That's why Moveworks
has streamlined the handoff to a live service desk agent, via a deep integration with Vayusphere. For
employees, this experience means there's just one place to go for help, regardless of their request.This
deep integration between Moveworks and Vayusphere allows employees to get support in seconds,
right from their favorite messaging tool, said Vayusphere CEO Pushpendra Mohta. By using AI to
understand employees' requests, Moveworks makes the handoff to a live service desk agent seamless.
The platform selects the right expert automatically, so even complicated support issues get solved right
away.About MoveworksMoveworks is revolutionizing how companies support their employees — with
the first AI platform that makes getting help at work effortless. The modern workday is full of
disruptions, from IT issues to HR updates to policy changes. Moveworks understands exactly what
employees need and provides the right solution in seconds, using conversational AI built for the

Employee Experience Insights (EXI) — an analytics and insights solution that uses breakthrough
techniques in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and machine learning to uncover the issues
slowing employees down the most. It gives CIOs an actionable to-do list based on which initiatives will
maximize productivity and ROI.Today, business leaders face an impossible task: Increase operational
efficiency, improve the employee experience, and do it all without first understanding what’s slowing
employees down. A recent report found that 82% of leaders acknowledge that employees will consider
leaving if their current employer does not provide access to the tools, technology, or information they
need to do their jobs well. Nearly three in five employees who do experience this frustration said it

makes them less productive. And yet, none of these leaders have had visibility into what’s slowing
productivity and what’s not, so their ability to actually fix these problems is limited — until
now.Employee Experience Insights uses advanced techniques in NLU and machine learning to analyze
and categorize data coming in from customers’ ITSM systems. It offers CIOs granular insights into the
biggest issues plaguing each employee persona — allowing leaders across every department to remove
inefficiencies and resolve employees’ frustrations in real time. And, while current ITSM insights tools
focus primarily on tickets and SLAs, EXI focuses entirely on people, which means businesses now have
answers to critical questions, like:At Databricks, we know the right data and AI can transform how an
organization does business, said Naveen Zutshi, CIO of Databricks. “My job is to empower our digital
workforce with the tools and technologies they need to perform at their best. With Moveworks'
sophisticated NLU and Employee Experience Insights, we have meaningful and actionable data to turn
thousands of requests into an efficient plan of action and a best-in-class employee experience.Employee
Experience Insights relies on Moveworks’ proprietary NLU models to understand and categorize each
employee issue. While most out-of-the-box NLU models are only able to categorize 20 - 30% of a
company’s tickets when attempting this same analysis, Moveworks’ NLU models are able to categorize
100% of them. That’s because our models are trained on three different sources:“Every help desk is
sitting on a treasure trove of information that could prevent future issues, before they happen,” said
Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “But business leaders have not yet been able to extract value from this
data because the majority of AI models fail to understand the vast ambiguity of human language. Recent
advancements in NLU have changed that — and it’s a milestone that will fundamentally change the way
business leaders make decisions moving forward.”To schedule a demo of Employee Experience Insights,

within the next 24 hours. Close this modal Jake Speyer, Director, Solutions ArchitectureSince ChatGPT’s
launch, my inbox has been loaded with pitches from startups claiming to be the next big conversational
AI platform. I have a constant stream of promises to triple my team’s revenue, earn myself a promotion,
or write my emails. And I suspect that decision-makers across industries and geographies have all felt
similarly pressured to take advantage of this new tech ASAP. Of course, a few of these products are
genuinely impressive. Others are essentially layering on top of the models built by OpenAI which
underpin ChatGPT, and most are somewhere in between. But all of them, unfortunately, are designed to
amaze non-experts during a demo.That said — given the costs and risks associated with deploying any
new tech, let alone something as complex as AI — it’s crucial to make sure that your investment is sound
in order to maximize ROI and minimize risk. So here’s the question: At a time when every product is “the
ChatGPT of _______,” how can you decide which ones to trust? My aim is to provide you with: As
consumers, we're accustomed to evaluating products based on their features. This is a perfectly
reasonable approach for familiar products like cars, where questions like “does it have heated seats”
and “can the trunk fit a large bike” can help us make an informed purchase decision.However, when it
comes to AI products, the feature-based approach falls short. Take self-driving cars, for example. It's
easy to get caught up in the car's impressive capabilities, such as its ability to change lanes with ease or
stop on a dime. But simply having these features doesn't necessarily mean the car will keep you safe in

the real world or perform well in a live environment.Instead, when evaluating AI products, it's crucial to
take a more holistic approach. This means looking beyond the features to assess the product's overall
effectiveness and reliability in real-world scenarios. It also means asking questions about the underlying
technology and algorithms, the data sets used to train the AI, and the product's track record in scaling
actual deployments. With so many conversational AI startups vying for your attention, asking the right
questions can distinguish genuine conversational AI from mere imitations. Relying solely on lists of
features can be misleading as they may not accurately reflect the product's real-world performance in
your environment. It's important to look beyond the surface level and ask relevant questions that can
reveal potential issues and ensure informed decision-making.To make the most of your conversational
AI demo, consider asking these five critical questions that can help you gain a deeper understanding of
the product's capabilities and potential limitations: When vendors provide demos, they often use their
own data to showcase their system's capabilities, which may not accurately reflect how the platform will
perform with your unique data. While the vendor's demo may appear impressive, it's essential to test
the system with your data to determine if it's the right fit for your needs. And by using your own data,
you can make sure that any analysis they provide uses their production models and processes, rather
than any behind-the-scenes wizardry.By testing the system with your data, you'll have a better
understanding of its performance and how it can handle your specific use cases. This approach allows
you to identify any potential issues or limitations before making a purchase, saving you time and money
in the long run. Many conversational AI vendors will say, “We use GPT-3!” without being able to dive
deeper into why large language models (LLMs) are a critical part of any conversational AI product.
Enterprise conversational AI requires the ability to understand the specific language used in that
workplace. It may be challenging for vendors to develop on their own due to a lack of sufficient data.
And it may be equally challenging for vendors who are just an interface on top of an LLM to answer
business-related queries. A demo would reveal the limits of that understanding immediately.This
question can also reveal how well-integrated and up-to-date the vendor’s technology is. Given how fast
this space is moving, it's important to know how many LLMs have been retired and how often new ones
are added to their stack. A vendor simply saying they use LLMs is not enough, as the best and most
efficient models are constantly evolving. It's important to understand the tangible value a vendor is
bringing to customers before investing in a product. Don't just take their word for it — ask for reference
calls with current customers to get a better understanding of their experience with the product, how it’s
performing, and how long it took to get them to that point. Or even better, ask them for a brief demo.
This can give you a glimpse into how the product has impacted their business, what benefits they have
seen, and any areas of improvement.Deploying large language models (LLMs) in production is a complex
process that requires an advanced Machine Learning Ops platform, a team of human annotators to
generate training data, and skilled engineers to optimize performance. It’s not something that’s going to
happen overnight. If a company has no prior experience using LLMs, it may take years to build the
necessary infrastructure. However, companies with a history of using LLMs are in a better position to
quickly adopt the capabilities of this technology in their products. This is to say that it’s important to
inquire about a vendor's experience with LLMs and their ability to deploy them in production as it can
provide insight into the vendor’s expertise and whether they are equipped to handle the complexities of
LLM deployment. With the rise of data breaches and cyber attacks, it's essential to know that your data
is secure. Ensure that the vendor has a clear and comprehensive security plan in place, including
measures such as data encryption, access control, and regular security audits. Additionally, ask about
any compliance certifications or regulations that the vendor adheres to, such as HIPAA or FedRAMP, to

ensure that they are meeting industry standards for data protection. By asking these questions, you can
gain a better understanding of the security measures in place and make an informed decision about the
safety of your data. In addition to asking the five questions above, look out for the following AI demo
red flags:TL;DR: Get your smartest people in the room and suggest going off-script during the demo.
Then, once you have a clear understanding of your own requirements and specific needs, push for
reference calls and case studies to see how other organizations have achieved similar goals. To avoid
making costly mistakes and ensure that you’re investing in AI solutions that are truly cutting-edge, you
need to double down on due diligence. A well-executed demo can provide valuable insights into the
product's capabilities and limitations, as well as help you identify potential red flags. By asking the right
questions and involving your team in the evaluation process, you can make more informed decisions
and choose the right conversational AI product for your organization.Schedule a demo with Moveworks

Varun Singh, Co-Founder and PresidentLet’s not fool ourselves. The massive number of apps and
workflows deployed by modern enterprises has made it increasingly difficult to work efficiently. Toggling
between fragmented systems has become the norm, with most employees spending a significant
amount of time just learning to navigate the latest platform, not knowing how to execute even the most
basic tasks or even which app has the information they need.How do you solve this challenge at scale
across the hundreds of workflows you've built and all the knowledge articles you've written? Creating
custom use cases can be a real headache, demanding immense manual labor and technical know-how. It
can take several months or even years to just launch one.Moveworks' new Creator Studio is set to
change all of that. Launching today, Creator Studio is a generative, no-code platform that connects
employees to every system and application across the enterprise with a unified, natural language
interface.With Creator Studio, the people who know your business best — service owners, system
owners, and enterprise architects across teams and departments — can create custom conversational AI
use cases in minutes, all without the need for coding, scripting, or complex dialogue flows.And you’ll be
able to deploy everywhere. Each new use case built with Creator Studio will be available in collaboration
tools, including Microsoft Teams, Slack, Whatsapp, Facebook, and more. This also includes support for
various modes of communication, like text, voice, and image, with on-the-fly translation in over 100
languages.Starting today, language will serve as a universal interface that enables employees to bypass
the complexities of enterprise ecosystems, search for information, and take action across every
application simply by asking. Companies like Coca-Cola Consolidated and Power Design are already
leveraging Creator Studio to use language as the primary interface for all apps, systems, workflows, and
automations.Interested in learning more? Schedule a demo! In the meantime, to give you an idea of
what's possible, let me highlight the three key Creator Studio workspaces: Paths, Queries, and Events.
Paths workspace is a powerful no-code tool that allows teams to create fully controllable, generative,
and custom conversations about specific, frequently requested topics.Traditional conversational AI
toolkits can be complex and difficult to work with, often requiring extensive technical knowledge and
scripting expertise. But with Paths, teams can easily describe the use case they need, and the platform's
advanced generative AI and natural language processing capabilities will take care of the rest.Figure 1:
With Creator Studio Paths, you can generate customer conversational AI use cases with natural
language.Paths makes it possible for anyone to use a system conversationally. Let’s look at expense
management. Instead of finding the right app and figuring out the new user interface, employees to
access their expense reports conversationally, saving time and effort for both themselves and their
managers.Other use cases include: Figure 2: Enable your employees to access their expenses with a
simple question with Creator Studio. In today's fast-paced business world, data is king. But the sheer
amount of information siloed away in countless systems and applications can make it difficult for
employees to quickly access the insights they need. That's where Queries come in.With Queries
workspace, employees can access data from any system, app, or workflow across their organization in
just a few clicks. Whether you need to check the status of a sales deal in your CRM or see the latest
updates on a project in your project management tool, Queries has you covered. Say goodbye to
juggling endless apps and systems and hello to fast, efficient access to the data you need to get your job
done.Figure 3: With Creator Studio Queries, you can securely access data from any system. With the
ability to enable data queries across applications, Creator Studio can enhance efficiency and productivity

for employees, including the Sales team. For example, by allowing the applicable employee to query
Salesforce data, Creator Studio can surface essential account information, freeing up time for more
impactful analyses and prospect conversations.Other use cases include: Figure 4: Creator Studio lets
anyone query Salesforce data so your team can focus on more impactful analyses. Keeping on top of
important events can be a real challenge, especially when you're juggling multiple tasks at once.With
Events workspace, you can integrate with any application to streamline notifications and send proactive,
actionable recommendations to help you stay on top of things before they slip through the cracks. From
timely reminders about employee anniversaries to suggestions for cleaning up your disk space, Events
helps you prioritize your work and stay ahead of the game.Figure 5: With Creator Studio Events, you can
send proactive, actionable recommendations.From a user-experience perspective, Creator Studio helps
employees act quickly in the face of critical events. With its rapid incident escalation capabilities, your
team can resolve issues quickly and with minimal disruption.Other use cases include: Figure 6: Creator
Studio helps developers to rapidly escalate business critical incidents. The field of conversational AI has
been transformed in recent years by using large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. Leveraging
these advancements, Creator Studio offers an enterprise-ready platform that is both highly effective and
infinitely scalable. Acting as a layer on top of your enterprise apps, Creator Studio allows users to
communicate and take control of systems and applications using natural language. With seamless
communication between each system and application, Moveworks can take action based on user needs,
increasing efficiency and productivity. Compared to existing conversational AI toolkits, such as rulesbased chatbots, Creator Studio is user-friendly and highly effective. Traditional solutions often require a
great deal of technical expertise, precise coding of dialog flows, and are challenging to restructure. On
the other hand, Creator Studio removes the need for dialogue flows altogether and instead harnesses
the power of generative AI and best-in-class LLMs, like GPT 3.5 and GPT-4 — grounded by the
Moveworks enterprise graph to improve robustness and reduce hallucinations — to generate any
custom conversational AI use case. It is an enterprise-ready platform that facilitates easy
implementation. At Moveworks, our dedication to pushing the boundaries of this technology is
exemplified through our early access to the world's most advanced large language models (LLMs) on the
market.We've been leveraging the power of LLMs and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for
several years, and our latest innovation, Creator Studio, builds on this foundation of best-in-class LLMs,
proprietary NLU, AI, and machine learning technology.One of the unique features of Creator Studio is
our use of multiple LLMs instead of just one. This approach is similar to having a toolbox with different
tools, each suited for different tasks. Multiple LLMs with different specializations and abilities enhance
their performance and better suit them for specific tasks. Using multiple LLMs provides a broader range
of perspectives and knowledge, leading to more well-rounded and accurate outputs.With LLMs and
NLU, we've changed the way conversational AI is used by the enterprise. Creator Studio is merely the
latest example of how. With Creator Studio, our customers can use our out-of-the-box solutions or build
customized conversational AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. This is achieved through cuttingedge LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and generative AI, which connect disparate apps and
workflows across enterprises and allows users to create custom conversational AI use cases in minutes,
without the need for coding, scripting, or complex dialogue flows.We're proud to be pioneers in using
LLMs for conversational AI and look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of this technology.
Creator Studio marks a significant milestone in the evolution of conversational AI for the enterprise. Its
powerful combination of large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning
technologies empowers enterprises to create highly-effective, infinitely-scalable, and personalized
